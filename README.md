Course search and enroll app developed as part of an assignment for CS639 (Building User Interfaces) at UW Madison. The app lets users browse a list of courses offered, see the ones that they have completed, get recommendations based on ratings they assigned to previous classes, and add courses to their cart. The design was tested for usability using heuristic evaluation.The design decisions (including screenshots) are explained in the files hvenugopalan_react1_beta.pdf and hvenugopalan_React2Beta.pdf.
